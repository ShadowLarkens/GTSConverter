# Giantess Converter

## Description

This project is more or less an adaptation of [Giantess Converter v3.05 by Byl & AbsentStar](http://www.giantessworld.net/convertor.html) to [Vuetify.js](https://vuetifyjs.com).

With this, you can get estimations for body size and attributes for someone that is converted into a giantess, providing their original & new sizes. No, there's really no point to this outside lewd uses.

You can view the live page of this site at https://shadowlarkens.github.io/GTSConverter.
